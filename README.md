# SampleTest

#This is my SampleTest repository.

#Its only purpose is it repeat what I've learned from The Odin Project but with a slight changes.

#Various files with different purposes and contents will be made under this repository.

#I made this to replicate what I have learned from my lessons, to see if I actually learned and understand every concepts that I am studying.

#I am hopeful that by doing this everyday I can actually learn, reflect, implement and share to everyone what I understands from every lessons I am taking.
