            <h1> Second Webpage</h1>
            <p>I made this webpage so I can practice the &lt a &gt tag</p>
            <p>OK,now let's try to make something a bit more complicated.</p>
            <p>let's try to use an anchor tag "&lt a &gt" within an image link. </p>
           <p> <a href="../images/musashi.jpeg"><img src="../images/musashi.jpeg"></a></p>
           <p> so as you can see the above sample, if you try to click the image of miyamoto you will notice that the wepbpage had removed every content within it except the image of miyamoto.</p>
           <p>that happens because we use an anchor tag "&lt a &gt" to wrap an "&lt img &gt" element and its value.</p>
           <h2> Now let's us try another sample of "&lt a &gt" tag.</h2>
           <p> This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <img src="../images/musashi.jpeg" alt="Miyamoto_Musashi"> link and image  will send you to miyamoto's wiki.</a></p>
